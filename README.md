Subsumption-based Sub-term Inference Framework (SSIF) project.

Used to audit Gene Ontology (GO) by leveraging its underlying graph structure and a novel term-algebra.

Consists of three main components.

(1) A sequence-based representation of GO concept terms by using part-of-speech parsing and sub-concept matching.

(2) The formulation of algebraic operations for the development of a term-algebra based on this sequence-based representation, using antonyms and subsumption-based longest subsequence alignment

(3) The construction of a set of conditional rules (similar to default rules) for backward subsumption inference aimed at uncovering semantic inconsistencies in GO and other ontological structures.
